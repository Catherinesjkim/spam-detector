# spam-detector
A machine learning project for detecting spam messages using Python. This notebook demonstrates end-to-end text classification with preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training using scikit-learn. Ideal for learning spam detection with real-world SMS data (from UCI).

Features:

- Dataset loading and inspection

- Text preprocessing and label encoding

- TF-IDF vectorization

- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)

- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)


Tech Stack:

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
